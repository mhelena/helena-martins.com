    <h2 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h2>
    <p>I am interested in mathematics and statistics applied to real problems related to public health, genetics and systems biology. My current projects involve the development of statistical approaches for the inference in population structure and local adaptation from genomic data. Considering this field, I'm interested in computational languages as R and Python.</p>

    <h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
    <h3 id="ucl">Research Fellow - Bioinformatician at University College London, London, England</h3>
    <p>Helena is Research fellow at University College London, Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, working on genomics in the epilepsies as part of a translational genomics programme under the supervision of Professor Sanjay Sisodiya. She is responsible for the application of genomic technologies in order to realise translation of personalised medicine for people with epilepsy.</p>
    <p>She works with research on genomic and close collaborates in external projects, such as with Genomics England Ltd (100,000 Genomes project) and other national (UK) and international initiatives.</p>
    <h3 id="phd">PhD in Computational and Mathematical Biology, Université de Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France (2015 – 2018)</h3>
    <p>Finding genetic signatures of local adaptation is the focus of my thesis. Considering this goal, I developed a new statistic method to identify loci under selection based on an extension of the Fixation Index statistic in order to handle populations with admixed individuals. The performance of my method was illustrated using by re-analysing genomic data from European lines of the plant species <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> and human genomic data from the population reference sample, POPRES. Currently, I’m working in new genome scans tests accounting Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) in the data using pruning methods. During my thesis, I worked especially with the languages R and Python. For simulated data, I acquired experience using the software ms and the toolset plink.</p>
    <h3 id="master">Master Student in Automation and Systems Engineering, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianópolis, Brazil. (2011-2014)</h3>
    <p>In my master research, I worked in the Systems Biology field. The base of my study was the little worm <em>Carnorhabditis elegans</em> (C. <em>elegans</em>), that is considered one of the best model organisms for research in neurobiology and in many process like; the adoptosis (programmed cell death), cell signalling, gene regulation, metabolism, the ageing and sex determining. With the increasing number of biological information, obtained through technological advances applied to the researches, it became crucial to utilize computational approaches to analyse the knowledge gathered about the worm C. <em>elegans</em>. During my master degree I created a model in Petri Nets for the phase L3 of vulvar development of this worm. The effectiveness of the proposed model was demonstrated comparing the results of Petri Nets simulations with experiments in vivo.</p>
    <h3 id="professor">Professor in the Mathematics Department in the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Brazil (2012 - 2013)</h3>
    <p>During the years of 2012 and 2013 I taught the courses of Financial Mathematics I and II. In this period, I gave classes for approximately 120 students. The courses included subjects as the accumulation function and the special cases of simple and compound interest; nominal and effective interest and discount rates, and the force of interest; valuation of discrete and continuous streams of payments; geometrically and arithmetically varying annuity models; application of interest theory to amortization of lump sums, depreciation, mortgages, and additional financial models.</p>
    <h3 id="tutor">Tutor in the Brazilian Government Distance Learning Program (EAD) in the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Brazil (2010)</h3>
    <p>In 2010, I worked as a tutor for the Brazilian Government Distance Learning Program (EAD). I gave online lessons, for about 1200 students from 18 cities across Brazil. I was responsible for the course “Methods of Physics and Mathematics”. To stay in contact with the students and manage the course, I used the open-source software learning management system, Moodle.</p>
    <h3 id="tutor-2">Member of `` Programa de Educação Tutorial (PET)’’ (special training program) in the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Brazil (2007-2010)</h3>
    <p>During my under graduation a worked in a group named Program of Tutorial Education (PET). The PET is a program of the Brazilian federal government to stimulate university research, teaching and extension activities at undergraduate level. The program is subordinated to the Department of Higher Education (SESu) of the Ministry of Education (MEC). PET members are usually the students with the best performances in the course. In my years as a member of the PET, I participated in multiple activities, for example: work in research groups with professors of the mathematics department, give training courses for graduating students (Matlab, Latex …), organize events for inside and outside of the university, edition of the Regional Olympiads of Mathematics Journal, give classes in community schools, coach students for the Brazilian Math Olympiad (OBM) among others.</p>
