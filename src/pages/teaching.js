      During the years of 2012 and 2013 I taught the courses of Financial Mathematics I and II. In this period, I gave
      classes for approximately 120 students. The courses included subjects as the accumulation function and the special
      cases of simple and compound interest; nominal and effective interest and discount rates, and the force of
      interest; valuation of discrete and continuous streams of payments; geometrically and arithmetically varying
      annuity models; application of interest theory to amortization of lump sums, depreciation, mortgages, and
      additional financial models.

      In 2010, I worked as a tutor for the Brazilian Government Distance Learning Program (EAD). I gave online lessons,
      for about 1200 students from 18 cities across Brazil. I was responsible for the course “Methods of Physics and
      Mathematics”. To stay in contact with the students and manage the course, I used the open-source software learning
      management system, Moodle.
